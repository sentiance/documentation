## Access Types

As a Sentiance user you could have various access roles assigned to you which grant or restrict data access.

### None

What everyone starts off with. By default no data access is granted which means you only have access to your own data.

### Spectator

With Spectator access, you can view the data for all users of your application. This includes user data in dashboards such as Insights.

### Developer

With Developer access, you can view the **secret key** of your application along with [App Tokens.](../backend/authentication-and-authorization.md#the-app-token) If an App Token is not present, contact support.
