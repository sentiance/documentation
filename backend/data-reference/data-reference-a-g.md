| overall | Float | An aggregation of all scores where we had sufficient data. A low score in one of the scores will result in a lower overall score.  |

| anticipative | Float | The anticipative driving score measures how well you anticipate traffic. A fast sequence of braking and accelerations in general traffic situations results in a lower score, the use of coasting results in a higher score. The higher your score, the more anticipative you drive! When we did not have sufficient data value will be -1. |
| focus | Float | The proportion of time (percentage) the user is focused while driving, being focused means: not using the phone, which is detected through phone handling. |
| mounted | Float | The proportion of time (percentage) the phone is mounted while driving. |
| hard_accel | Float | Measures how often you accelerate hard. Every hard acceleration will be penalised by subtracting a percentage of your score. When we do not have sufficient data this value will be -1. |
| hard_brake | Float | Measures how often you need to brake hard. Every hard brake will be penalised by subtracting a percentage of your score. When we do not have sufficient data this value will be -1. |

| legal_v2 | Float | The legal driving score measures how well you adhere to speed limits. The higher your score, the more you respect the speed limits! When we did not have sufficient data value will be -1. The difference with legal score is that this score has better speed estimation. |
| hard_turn | Float | Measures how often you turn hard. Every hard turn will be penalised by subtracting a percentage of your score. When we do not have sufficient data this value will be -1. |
| smooth_v2 | Float | The smooth driving score measures how smooth you drive. High accelerations, heavy braking and heavy turning result in a lower score. The use of coasting results in a higher score. Scores are normalized with respect to a wide population. The higher your score, the smoother you drive! When we did not have sufficient sensor data characterizing your drive, the value will be -1. Beside an updated normalization, the difference with smooth score v1 is that turns are also taken in account. |
| anticipative_v2 | Float | The anticipative driving score measures how well you anticipate turns. Hard accelerations before or hard braking during a turn result in a lower score. The use of coasting results in a higher score. The higher your score, the more anticipative you drive! When we did not have sufficient sensor data characterizing your drive, the value will be -1. Beside an updated normalization, this new version has a more accurate detection of brakes in turns. |
