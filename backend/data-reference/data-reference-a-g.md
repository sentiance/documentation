| smooth | Float | The smooth driving score measures how calm you drive. High accelerations and heavy braking result in a lower score, the use of coasting results in a higher score. The higher your score, the calmer you drive! When we do not have sufficient data the value will be -1.<br><br><code>**Deprecation notice**</code><br>smooth is deprecated.<br>Deprecated in favor of `smooth_v2`. | False |
