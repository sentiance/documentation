| smooth\_v2                           | Float  | The smooth driving score measures how smooth you drive. High accelerations, heavy braking and heavy turning result in a lower score. Scores are normalized with respect to a wide population. The higher your score, the smoother you drive! When we do not have sufficient sensor data characterizing your drive, the value will be -1. Beside an updated normalization, the difference with smooth score v1 is that turns are also taken in account.                                               | True     |
| anticipative\_v2                     | Float  | The anticipative driving score measures how well you anticipate turns.

This means you no longer need to filter our Firehose or API output by AnalysisType. Previously, trips had three analysis types based on processing latency. They were, namely, 'processed,' 'indepth,' and 'preliminary.' Based on your use cases, you may have filtered out certain types. As we will deprecate this field on Dec 10, 2021, you will need to change your backend if you use the AnalysisType field.</p> | True     |

This means you no longer need to filter our Firehose or API output by AnalysisType. Previously, trips had three analysis types based on processing latency. They were, namely, 'processed,' 'indepth,' and 'preliminary.' Based on your use cases, you may have filtered out certain types. As we will deprecate this field on Dec 10, 2021, you will need to change your backend if you use the AnalysisType field.</p> | True     |

This means you no longer need to filter our Firehose or API output by AnalysisType. Previously, trips had three analysis types based on processing latency. They were, namely, 'processed,' 'indepth,' and 'preliminary.' Based on your use cases, you may have filtered out certain types. As we will deprecate this field on Dec 10, 2021, you will need to change your backend if you use the AnalysisType field.</p> | True     |
