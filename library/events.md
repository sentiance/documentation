# Events

Situational events describe what a user is doing. Events are derived from time, location and motion data.  
They are available as a timeseries of stationaries and transports with duration.

Is the user in transport? In a car? Or a train? Walking? What route?  
Is the user stationary? What store or business is at that location?  
Is the location a home or work location?  


### Stationary Events

When a user is stationary for a few minutes at a certain location, a Stationary Event will be available.

This Stationary Event is enriched with:

* The significance of what this place means to the user based on historical data. Values: home, work, regular, non-regular, poi \(point of interest\), new.
* Place/venue information like name and categories
* Basic address information like country, city and city\_type

#### Example

[Lookup the Stationary event in the data model reference](../backend/data-reference/data-reference-q-z.md#stationary).

}
```

### Transport Events

When a user is not stationary at a location, the user is in Transport. For each of these transports a Transport Event will be available.

Additional data derived from sensor data--distance, transport mode, advanced map-matching--is done to build an accurate trajectory and driving behavior analysis.

Transport Modes can include car, walking, biking, train, bus, tram, flight, etc. \(check the full list [here](../backend/data-reference/data-reference-q-z.md#transportmode)\).

Depending on SDK configuration, additional features are derived from the sensor data.   
Only available in full SDK configuration:

* behavior\_scores
* behavior\_features
* behavior\_annotations
