# Events

Situational events describe what a user is doing.

Events are derived from time, location and motion data.  
They are available as a timeseries of stationaries and transports with duration.

Is the user in transport? In a car? Or a train? Walking? What route?  
Is the user stationary? What store or business is at that location?  
Is the location a home or work location?  


### Stationary events

When a user is a few minutes stationary at a certain location, a stationary event will be available.

This stationary event is enriched with:

* The significance what this place means to the user based on historical data. Values: home, work, regular, nonregular, poi, new.
* Place/venue information like name and categories
* Basic address information like country, city and city\_type

  }
}
```

### Transport events

When a user is not stationary at a location, the user is in Transport. For each of these transports a Transport event will be available.

Additional data derived from the sensor data: distance, transport mode, advanced map-matching is done to build an accurate trajectory and driving behavior analysis.

Transport modes: car, walking, biking, train, bus, tram, flight

Depending on SDK configuration, additional features are derived from the sensor data.   
Only available in full SDK configuration:

* behavior\_scores
* behavior\_features
* behavior\_annotations
