# Security, Privacy and Terms of Service \(FAQ\)

## How do I set up MFA for logging in on Insights as a Business User?

For logging in as a Business User on Insights \(with access to personal data\) , you will be required to enable MFA \(Multi-Factor Authentication\). This reduces the risk of unwanted access to your account and thus significantly increases security. 

When you are invited to Insights, you will automatically be requested to set up MFA. To do so, you will need to have a 3rd-party authentication app installed. Sentiance supports any TOTP-based authentication app, but we recommend using one from the vendors below:

* Google Authenticator \([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)\)
* Authy \([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twilio-authy/id494168017)\)
* Microsoft Authenticator \([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)\)

## How do I stop the SDK from tracking a user?

The SDK has a built-in start-stop functionality, that can be used to manually stop the SDK from tracking when certain parameters are met. You can find more information [here.](https://docs.sentiance.com/sdk/appendix/controlled-detections)

## How do I make sure all data of a specific user is removed from the Sentiance platform?

If a specific user's data needs to be permanently removed from the Sentiance platform \(i.e. after receiving a GDPR data removal request\), please contact [support@sentiance.com](mailto:support@sentiance.com).
