# UserContext



Represents the user's context during a specific moment in time. The context includes:

* a list of recent events, such as stationaries and transports;
* the user's active moments and segments at the time this context was constructed;
* the user's home and work locations;
* the user's last know location, if SDK detections were running.
* &lt;/ul&gt;
