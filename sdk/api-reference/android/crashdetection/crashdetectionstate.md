| Name                                                | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CANDIDATE\_DETECTED                                 | A crash candidate has been detected                                                    |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_WEAK\_IMPACT                  | The crash candidate has been discarded due to weak impact                              |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_NON\_VEHICLE\_TRANSPORT\_MODE | The crash candidate has been discarded due to non-vehicular transport mode             |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_PRE\_IMPACT\_NOISE            | The crash candidate has been discarded due to too much noise in the pre-impact signal  |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_LOW\_SPEED\_BEFORE\_IMPACT    | The crash candidate has been discarded due to low pre-impact speed                     |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_POST\_IMPACT\_NOISE           | The crash candidate has been discarded due to too much noise in the post-impact signal |
| CANDIDATE\_DISCARDED\_HIGH\_SPEED\_AFTER\_IMPACT    | The crash candidate has been discarded due to high post-impact speed                   |
