# React Native

We support React Native apps with our React Native Sentiance library packages, which can be found on NPM. We have tested them with React Native v0.60.0 and above.

Our React Native libraries are open source, and can be found at [https://github.com/sentiance/react-native-sentiance](https://github.com/sentiance/react-native-sentiance).
