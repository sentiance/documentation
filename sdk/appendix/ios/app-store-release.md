# App Store Release

When releasing an app that includes the Sentiance SDK, it is required to inform your users that the use of background locations can have an impact on the device's battery life.

When submitting an app for approval on the App Store, you must include the following message in the app description:

> Caution: continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
