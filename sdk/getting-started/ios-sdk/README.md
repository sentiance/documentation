# iOS Quick Start

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Platform requirements

The Sentiance SDK requires iOS 9.0 or higher. Apps should be built with the latest iOS SDK provided by Apple/Xcode.

Building and running your app on M1 Mac simulators is possible with the use of our [custom TensorFlow Lite framework](../../appendix/ios/m1-simulator-support.md).
{% endhint %}

If you want to get started quickly, you can check out our [sample application](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-ios). If you prefer to integrate the SDK in your existing app, read on.
