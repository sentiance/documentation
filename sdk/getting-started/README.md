# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
**Make sure to think about your development environments before you get started**

It's a best practice to use multiple environments during the development of your apps \(development, testing, production, etc.\) 

You will need a separate app id & secret for each of these environments, make sure to mention this in your request.

This will also allow us to enable debugging & analytics on your development environment if necessary.
{% endhint %}

### Requesting an app id & secret

In order to properly integrate the Sentiance SDK you will need an app id & secret. You can request an app id & secret by emailing to [support@sentiance.com](mailto:support@sentiance.com)

### Getting your app credentials

1. Head over to[ insights.sentiance.com/\#/](http://insights.sentiance.com/#/)
2. You should see at least one cell with the name of your app or company
   * You may see one per development environment as mentioned above.
3. The first field contains your app id & an easy copy button
4. Click on "Click to reveal" under app secret
5. You will now have an appID & secret key ready for integrating the Sentiance SDK into your mobile application

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to perform the above steps you will need developer permissions for your app / company.
