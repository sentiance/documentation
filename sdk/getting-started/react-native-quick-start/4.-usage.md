# 5. Enabling Detections

After creating a Sentiance user, you can enable SDK detections. This will allow the Sentiance SDK to run in the background, and intelligently detect a user's real-world movements, while collecting sensor, location, and motion activity data.

```javascript
import { enableDetections } from '@sentiance-react-native/core';
try {
    const result = await enableDetections();
    console.log(`SDK detection status is now ${result.detectionStatus}`);
} catch(e) {
    console.log('Failed to start detections: ' + e);
}
```

After detections are successfully enabled, you can determine whether the SDK is able to detect, by checking the detection status:

```kotlin
const detectionStatus = result.detectionStatus;

switch() {
    case 'ENABLED_AND_DETECTING':
        // Detections are enabled and running
        break;
    case 'ENABLED_BUT_BLOCKED':
        // Detections are enabled but blocked
        break;
    default:
        // Detections weren't enabled
}
```

If detections are blocked, you can check the SDK status to see what's blocking them. Usually, this is caused by insufficient permissions or a disabled location tracking.

#### Enabling Detections Is Persistent

When you enable detections, the SDK will remember this and automatically enable them the next time the app restart. Therefore, you do not need to enable them every time. You only need to make sure that you are [properly initializing the SDK](initialization.md) during every app startup.
