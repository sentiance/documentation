### Platform requirements

The Sentiance React Native Module works on React Native 0.60 and above. Apps should be built with the latest React Native version.

Please check the [iOS](../ios-sdk/) and [Android](../android-sdk/) pages as well for platform specific requirements.

If you want to get started quickly, you can check out our [sample application](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-react-native). If you prefer to manually integrate the SDK in your existing app, please read on.
