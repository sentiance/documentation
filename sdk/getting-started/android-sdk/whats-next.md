As the SDK detects your trips and stationary moments, the data will be uploaded to the Sentiance platform and available for visualization on our [Audience dashboard](https://audience.sentiance.com/dashboard).

To learn more about how our SDK works and what other features it offers, check out the [appendix](../../appendix/) section.

You can reach out to us at support@sentiance.com to troubleshoot integration issues or if you have additional questions. Be sure to check out our [FAQ](../../faq/android.md) as well.
