# 1. Android Checklist

Follow the step below to integrate the Android SDK.

### 1. Installation

<details>

<summary>1.1 Dependency</summary>

Add the Sentiance repository to your project (top-level) _build.gradle_ file.

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven {
      url "https://repository.sentiance.com"
    }
  }
}
```

In the _build.gradle_ file of your app module, add the following line to the dependencies section.

```
implementation ('com.sentiance:sdk:4.21.2@aar') { transitive = true }
```

</details>

### 2. Configuration

<details>

<summary>2.2 Notification &#x26; Foreground Service</summary>

Depending on your app's configuration and OS version, the SDK may need to start a foreground service every now and again. You must therefore pass a notification that can be used by the service. In the next section, you'll find a handy notification creation method.

Learn more on how to easily setup a [sample notification](https://docs.sentiance.com/sdk/appendix/android/notification-management)

</details>

### 3. Usage

<details>

<summary>3.1 SentianceHelper.kt</summary>

For a quick start we have created helper file a couple of methods to easily get started. [Download this file](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-android/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/sentiancesdksample\_app\_android/helpers/SentianceHelper.kt) and place it anywhere accessible in your codebase.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3.2 Initialization &#x26; Background Collection</summary>

Insert the following line in the _onCreate_ method of your MainApplication.kt file_._ This line ensures that the SDK is initialized and can collect data while the application is in the background.

```
# MainApplication.kt

SentianceHelper().initSdk(applicationContext, null)
```

[See reference](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-android/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/sentiancesdksample\_app\_android/MainApplication.kt#L14)

</details>

### 4. Data Collection & SDK User Creation

In order for the SDK to collect data the application would need to first "create a user" on the SDK. The "createUser" should ideally be called when the user registers, logs in.



<details>

<summary>4.1 createUser</summary>

Invoke the _SentianceHelper().createUser_ method at the moment you are ready to start the data collection. (e.g on user login, on user registration, at a feature, etc)

```swift
SentianceHelper.createUser(SDKParams(
   appId,
   secret,
   null,
   link,
   callback
))
```

[See reference](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-android/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/sentiancesdksample\_app\_android/MainActivity.kt#L39)

</details>

<details>

<summary>4.2 link</summary>

This method will receive the parameters: `installId, MetaUserLinkerCallback`

[See reference](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-android/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/sentiancesdksample\_app\_android/MainActivity.kt#L51)

</details>

<details>

<summary>4.3 User linking in your backend</summary>

In the `link` function, at this point, make your backend tell the Sentiance backend which `userId` should be related to the `installId`

[See reference](https://github.com/sentiance/sample-apps-api/blob/master/src/routes.js#L61)

</details>

<details>

<summary>4.3 metaUserLinkerCallback.success()</summary>

Upon your backend successfully performing the user linking execute the&#x20;

```
metaUserLinkerCallback.success()
```

</details>

### Verifying the Integration

You can verify the SDK integration by reading the following statuses from the SDK

| Sentiance.getInstance().getInitState()             | **INITIALIZED** |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Sentiance.getInstance().getSdkStatus().startStatus | **STARTED**     |

_Note: If you find the **startStatus** to be **PENDING** it usually implies that the user has not granted **location:always** permission. To know more,_ [_click here_](https://docs.sentiance.com/sdk/api-reference/android/sdkstatus/startstatus)__

You can continue reading through the next sections to get a deeper understanding of the integration and the SDK capabilities.&#x20;
