# Battery Optimization

[Don't Kill My App](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) (no affiliation to Sentiance) keeps track of different manufacturers' practices on battery optimization techniques that severely restrict how your app can run in the background and the potential solutions.&#x20;

Below manufacturers are notoriously known for their strict requirements for background process restrictions, and without **proper user-onboarding, and correct battery-related settings, Sentiance SDK cannot guarantee a consistent output on these devices.**
