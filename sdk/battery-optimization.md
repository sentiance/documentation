# Battery Optimization

[Don't Kill My App](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) \(No affiliation to [Sentiance](https://sentiance.com)\) keeps track of different manufacturers' practices on battery optimization techniques that severely restrict how your app can run in the background and the potential solutions. 

Below manufacturers are notoriously known for their strict requirements for background process restrictions, and without **proper user-onboarding, and correct battery-related settings, Sentiance SDK cannot guarantee a consistent output on these devices.**
