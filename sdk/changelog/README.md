# Changelog

Releases are following a semantic versioning scheme in the form of **X.Y.Z** where:

* X stands for a major version
* Y stands for a minor version
* Z stands for a hotfix version

Bumping a specific version identifier indicates the type of release:

* major release: bump the major version, e.g. **4.9.0** -> **5.0.0**
* minor release: bump the minor version, e.g. **4.9.0** -> **4.10.0**
* hotfix release: bump the hotfix version, e.g. **4.9.0** -> **4.9.1**

The following guarantees are made with our releases:

* breaking API changes for [Production Ready](../appendix/feature-production-readiness.md) features require major releases
* deprecated features are only removed in major releases
* backwards compatible new features might be added to minor releases
* existing features might be deprecated in minor releases
* hotfix releases only contain bug fixes for existing features

Users of the SDK are encouraged to update to the latest available hotfix release at any time.
