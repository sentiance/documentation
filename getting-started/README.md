## Create an application

An application provides the ID & key you can use to integrate the Sentiance SDK's into your mobile application and manage the SDK behavior.

1. Head over to [developers.sentiance.com/apps](https://developers.sentiance.com/apps)
2. Use the "Add app" button to add a new application
3. It's a good practice to use the same application name as in the App Store / Play Store
4. Save your changes
5. You will now have an app id & secret ready for integrating the Sentiance SDK into your mobile application

{% hint style="warning" %}
The same app id & secret should be used for a single mobile app that is available both on iOS & Android.
{% endhint %}
