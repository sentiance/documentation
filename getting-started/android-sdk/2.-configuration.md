In the `onCreate` method of your `Application` class, create an `SdkConfig` object with your Sentiance app ID and secret.

```java
SdkConfig sdkConfig = new SdkConfig.Builder(APP_ID, SECRET, notification).build();
```

If you don't have an app ID and secret yet, please refer to [Getting Started](../#create-an-application).

## If you don't have a custom Application class yet

First create a new class that extends `Application`.

```java
import android.app.Application;
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
    }
}
```

Then reference this new class in the application tag of the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```java
<application
  android:name="com.example.appname.MyApplication">
  <!-- Activities -->
</application>
```
