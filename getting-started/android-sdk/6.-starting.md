# 6. Starting

Starting is only allowed after successful initialization. Ideally, this is also done from `Application.onCreate` as that will guarantee that the SDK is running as often as possible.

If you want to have more control over when the Sentiance SDK is running, see [Control detection status](https://developers.sentiance.com/docs/sdk/android/control-detections).

Call the `start` method from the body of `OnInitCallback.onInitSuccess()`:

```java
@Override
public void onInitSuccess() {
    Sentiance.getInstance(context).start(startCallback);
}
```

If you want to be informed when this has finished, you can pass an `OnStartFinishedHandler` to the `start` function.
