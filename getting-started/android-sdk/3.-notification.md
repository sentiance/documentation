# 2. Notification

Depending on your app's configuration and OS version, the SDK may need to start a foreground service every now and again. You must therefore pass a notification that can be used by the service.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a notification that can be passed to the `SdkConfig`builder:

```java
private Notification createNotification() {
    // PendingIntent that will start your application's MainActivity
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
    PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0);
     
    // On Oreo and above, you must create a notification channel
    String channelId = "channel-id";
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
        NotificationChannel channel = new NotificationChannel(channelId, 
        	"Channel name", NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_LOW);
        channel.setShowBadge(false);
        NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
        notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel);
    }

    return new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, channelId)
            .setContentTitle(getString(R.string.app_name) + " is running")
                .setContentText("Touch to open.")
                .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)
                .setShowWhen(false)
                .setSmallIcon(R.mipmap.ic_launcher)
                .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_MIN)
                .build();
}
```

### Notification Management <a id="notification_management"></a>

Create a separate notification channel for Sentiance to show non-intrusive notifications. When the Sentiance SDK is running, your application should show a subtle notification icon, with an appropriate message informing your users about the ongoing detection.

Setting the channel importance to `IMPORTANCE_LOW` and the notification priority to `PRIORITY_MIN` will create notifications that do not pop up in front of the user, or cause sounds and device vibrations. The goal is to not distract the user every time the Sentiance SDK runs, as this will cause frustration and lead to eventual app removal.

Properly wording your notification is also important to let your users know why your application is running. State what value you're adding to your user at that moment. For example:Journeys is running

Working in the background to improve your driving habits

Finally, it's important to let your users know that they can easily prioritize and disable notifications. Using the following snippet on Android 8 and above, you can take your user to the channel configuration setting with a single click:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_CHANNEL_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS)
		.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_APP_PACKAGE, context.getPackageName())
		.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_CHANNEL_ID, channelId);
startActivity(intent);
```
