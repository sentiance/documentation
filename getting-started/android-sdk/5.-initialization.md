# 5. Initialization

{% hint style='danger' %} This document refers to deprecated parts of the platform and has been left intact to help customers with legacy integrations. In order to access the latest platform features and documentation, please go to https://docs.sentiance.com. {% endhint %}

Initialization is a very important step; before initialization, almost none of the methods on the Sentiance SDK interface are allowed to be called \(with the exception of `getInstance`, `init` and `isInitialized`\).

This is how you can initialize the SDK:

* In the `onCreate` method of your `Application` class, pass the `SdkConfig` you created in the previous step to the `init` method of the Sentiance SDK.
* An additional `OnInitCallback` must be passed as well, which will inform you when initialization has failed or succeeded.

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    // Creation of SdkConfig here, see previous step

    OnInitCallback initCallback = new OnInitCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onInitSuccess() {
        }
        @Override
        public void onInitFailure(InitIssue issue) {
        }
    };

    Sentiance.getInstance(this).init(sdkConfig, initCallback);
}
```
