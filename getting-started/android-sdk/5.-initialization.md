# 5. Initialization

Initialization is a very important step; before initialization, almost none of the methods on the Sentiance SDK interface are allowed to be called \(with the exception of `getInstance`, `init` and `isInitialized`\).

This is how you can initialize the SDK:

* In the `onCreate` method of your `Application` class, pass the `SdkConfig` you created in the previous step to the `init` method of the Sentiance SDK.
* An additional `OnInitCallback` must be passed as well, which will inform you when initialization has failed or succeeded.

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    // Creation of SdkConfig here, see previous step
    
    OnInitCallback initCallback = new OnInitCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onInitSuccess() {
        }
        @Override
        public void onInitFailure(InitIssue issue) {
        }
    };
        
    Sentiance.getInstance(this).init(sdkConfig, initCallback);
}
```
