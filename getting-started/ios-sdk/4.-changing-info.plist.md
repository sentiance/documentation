# 4. Changing Info.plist

### Permission message

As Sentiance SDK requires a user's location and motion data, it is required to get the permissions from the user before collecting such data.

{% hint style="success" %}
Keep the text short and specific, use sentence case, and be polite so people don't feel pressured. There’s no need to include your app name.
{% endhint %}

When the application requests permission for background locations or motion activities, a message will be shown to the user. You can configure this message by changing the value for the following keys in `Info.plist`

* `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`
* `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
* `NSMotionUsageDescription`
* `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`

## Guideline

Apple's guideline: [Link](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/requesting-permission/)

In brief, below are the things to consider for an optimal UX.

* Request personal data only when your app clearly needs it.
* Explain why your app needs the information.
* Don’t request location information unnecessarily.
* Request permission at launch only when necessary for your app to function. 
* Use the system-provided alert.
