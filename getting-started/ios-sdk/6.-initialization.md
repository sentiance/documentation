# 6. Initialization

{% hint style='danger' %} This document refers to deprecated parts of the platform and has been left intact to help customers with legacy integrations. In order to access the latest platform features and documentation, please go to https://docs.sentiance.com. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Until the SDK is properly initialized, most of the methods in the SDK will not work with the exception of `sharedInstance`, `initWithConfig` and `isInitialized.`
{% endhint %}

In the project's AppDelegate file,

```objectivec
@import SENTSDK;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Creation of SENTConfig here, see previous step
   SENTConfig *conf = [[SENTConfig alloc] initWithAppId:@"APPID"
                                           secret:@"SECRET"
                                           launchOptions:launchOptions];

   // Initialize SDK
    [[SENTSDK sharedInstance] initWithConfig:conf success:^{

    } failure:^(SENTInitIssue issue) {

    }];

    return YES;
}
```

1. In the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your `AppDelegate`, pass the `SENTConfig` you created in the previous step to the `initWithConfig` method of the Sentiance SDK.
2. Additionally, a `success` and `failure` block must be passed as well, which will inform you when initialization has failed or succeeded.
